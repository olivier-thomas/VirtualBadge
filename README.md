# VirtualBadge
The goal is to create a virtual badge so the user can declare when he arrives in the morning and when he leaves at the end of his workday.

I am thinking that it will be a Java app working locally, and if it is not too much trouble may be pushing it to Android so that it can be downloaded by everyone for free.
